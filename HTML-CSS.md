## HC 1.1 HTML & CSS
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is a markup language used to structure and define the content of web pages. It consists of elements, each represented by tags, which indicate how content should be displayed or structured. Key facts about HTML include:

Semantic Markup: HTML offers a range of semantic elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables that convey the meaning and structure of content to both browsers and search engines.

Hyperlinks: HTML allows the creation of hyperlinks using anchor (<a>) tags, enabling navigation between pages and websites.

Forms: HTML forms facilitate user input and data submission, crucial for tasks like user registration and online shopping.

HTML5: The latest version, HTML5, introduced new elements and features for multimedia integration (audio and video), canvas for drawing, and improved support for web applications.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is a style sheet language used for describing how HTML elements are presented and styled on a web page. It separates content from presentation, allowing for consistent design across a website. Key facts about CSS include:

Selectors and Properties: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and applies properties like color, font size, margin, and padding to control their appearance.

Cascading: CSS rules can cascade, meaning that multiple style sheets can be applied, and conflicts are resolved based on specificity and order.

Responsive Design: CSS is instrumental in creating responsive web layouts, ensuring content adapts to various screen sizes and devices through techniques like media queries.

Preprocessors: Developers often use CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less to write cleaner, more maintainable code with variables, functions, and nesting.

Combining HTML and CSS effectively is essential for modern web development. HTML structures content logically, and CSS enhances its visual appeal. This separation of content and style improves maintainability and user experience. Proficiency in these technologies is fundamental for web developers, enabling them to build user-friendly, accessible, and responsive websites and applications.

## HC 1.5 CSS Pre-processorer (ex SASS/LESS)
 What are CSS Pre-processors?
CSS pre-processors are scripting languages that extend the capabilities of standard CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). They introduce features like variables, nesting, functions, and mixins, allowing developers to write more efficient and maintainable stylesheets. Two popular CSS pre-processors are SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and LESS (Leaner CSS).

Key Concepts:

Variables: CSS pre-processors enable the use of variables to store and reuse values, such as colors and font sizes, throughout the stylesheet. This promotes consistency and simplifies updates.
Nesting: Developers can nest CSS rules within one another, mirroring the HTML structure. This results in more organized and readable code.
Functions and Mixins: Functions and mixins allow for the creation of reusable code blocks, reducing redundancy and making stylesheets more maintainable.

How are CSS Pre-processors Used?
CSS pre-processors are used by web developers during the styling phase of web development. They write styles in the pre-processor language (SASS or LESS) and then compile it into standard CSS using pre-processor-specific tools or build processes. The resulting CSS is then linked to the HTML.

Why Use CSS Pre-processors?
CSS pre-processors offer several advantages, including:
Efficiency: Variables and mixins reduce code duplication and make stylesheets more efficient to write and maintain.
Readability: Nesting improves code organization and makes it easier to understand the relationships between HTML elements and their styles.
