Key Concepts:

Classes and Objects: In PHP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that objects of the class will have. Objects are instances of classes, representing individual entities with their own data and behavior.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a class. It restricts direct access to an object's internal state, promoting data integrity and security.
Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class (subclass or child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass or parent class). This promotes code reuse and supports the "is-a" relationship.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. It allows for the flexibility of using different objects interchangeably.
Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into manageable parts. In PHP, abstract classes and methods define a blueprint without providing a complete implementation, leaving specific details to subclasses.

How OOP in PHP Is Used:
OOP in PHP is used to create structured and modular code. It is particularly beneficial for building large-scale web applications and frameworks. Popular PHP frameworks like Laravel and Symfony heavily rely on OOP principles to provide robust and maintainable codebases.
