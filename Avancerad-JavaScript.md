## AJ 1.2 Express
What is Express?
Express, often referred to as Express.js, is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, APIs, and server-side applications. Express simplifies the process of creating scalable and efficient web applications by providing a lightweight structure and a range of built-in tools and middleware.

Key Concepts:
Routing: Express offers a powerful routing system that allows developers to define how an application responds to client requests. Routes can handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL patterns, making it easy to create RESTful APIs.
Middleware: Middleware functions in Express enable developers to add custom functionality to the request and response objects in the application's request-response cycle. This allows for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
Templating: Although not included in Express itself, developers often use template engines like EJS, Handlebars, or Pug with Express to render dynamic HTML content on the server-side.

How is Express Used?
Express is used by developers to build web applications and APIs. They define routes, specify how the application should respond to various HTTP requests, and utilize middleware to add functionality. Express applications can be used to serve static files, create API endpoints, handle form submissions, and perform various other server-side tasks.

Why Use Express?
Express is widely adopted for several reasons:
Minimalism: It provides only the essential tools and structures, allowing developers to add components and libraries as needed, making it highly flexible.
Performance: Express is known for its high performance, making it suitable for building both small-scale and large-scale applications.
Large Community: The extensive user base and active community support ensure that developers have access to a wealth of resources and third-party middleware.

When to Use Express?
Express is an excellent choice for web developers when building web applications or APIs using Node.js. It is particularly valuable when you need to create RESTful APIs, single-page applications, or server-side rendering for web pages.

## AJ 1.3 Progressive Web Apps
What are Progressive Web Apps?
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a modern approach to building web applications that provide a native app-like experience while still being delivered through the web. They combine the best of both web and mobile app technologies to offer features like offline access, push notifications, and fast loading, all while maintaining the openness and accessibility of the web.

Key Concepts:

Progressive Enhancement: PWAs are designed with a progressive enhancement approach. They work on all devices and browsers but offer enhanced features on supporting platforms.

Service Workers: Service workers are a crucial component of PWAs. They are JavaScript scripts that run in the background, enabling features like offline caching, background synchronization, and push notifications.

Responsive Design: PWAs use responsive design principles to ensure that they look and function well on various screen sizes and orientations, from desktops to mobile devices.

How are Progressive Web Apps Used?

PWAs are used to create web applications that offer a user experience similar to native mobile apps. Developers build PWAs using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They implement service workers to handle offline caching and background processes, making the app resilient to network interruptions.

Why Use Progressive Web Apps?

PWAs offer several benefits:

Cross-Platform Compatibility: PWAs work on different platforms, including desktop and mobile, reducing the need for platform-specific development.

Improved Performance: Service workers enable faster load times and offline access, improving the overall user experience.

Lower Development and Maintenance Costs: Developing a single PWA can be more cost-effective than building separate native apps for multiple platforms.

Accessibility: PWAs are inherently accessible because they are web-based and can be used on various devices.

When to Use Progressive Web Apps?

PWAs are suitable for a wide range of applications, particularly when you want to provide a consistent user experience across multiple platforms without the overhead of developing and maintaining separate native apps. They are excellent choices for content-driven sites, e-commerce, news, and other interactive web applications.

How Knowledge of Progressive Web Apps Benefits Product Development

Understanding PWAs allows developers to create web applications that offer a native app-like experience with improved performance and accessibility. This knowledge expands the reach of the product to a broader audience while reducing development costs and efforts compared to building separate native apps for different platforms.


## AJ 1.4 Typningssystem f√∂r Javascript (ex TypeScript, Flow)
Static Type Checking: Typing systems for JavaScript introduce static type checking, which means that type-related errors are detected at compile-time rather than runtime. This early error detection enhances code reliability and prevents hard-to-diagnose runtime issues.

Type Annotations: Developers use type annotations or declarations to specify variable types, function parameters, and return values. For example, in TypeScript, you can declare a variable like this: let age: number;. This explicit typing helps in documenting the code and clarifying its intended behavior.

Type Inference: Some typing systems, like TypeScript, support type inference. They can automatically deduce variable types based on assigned values, reducing the need for manual type annotations and streamlining the development process.

Error Prevention: The primary advantage of these systems is error prevention. By catching type-related errors early, developers can write more reliable code, reducing the risk of runtime failures.

Enhanced Tooling: Typing systems come with superior tooling support, such as code editors and IDEs that offer code completion, type hints, and error highlighting. This improves developer productivity and code quality.

Documentation: Type annotations serve as documentation, making the code more understandable and maintainable. They provide clear insights into the data types expected by functions and variables.

Project Scale: Typing systems are particularly valuable for medium to large-scale projects where code maintainability is crucial. They also excel when integrating JavaScript with other technologies, as types offer clear interfaces and facilitate interoperability.

Examples: TypeScript and Flow are two prominent examples. TypeScript, developed by Microsoft, extends JavaScript with static typing and features like interfaces and generics. Flow, from Facebook, is a static type checker that uses type annotations for error checking.

Development Efficiency: Understanding typing systems enhances development efficiency. Developers can write safer, more maintainable code and benefit from advanced tooling, ultimately improving the overall quality of the product.

## AJ 1.5 Funktionell programmering i JavaScript
Functional programming is a programming paradigm increasingly popular in JavaScript. It centers on treating functions as first-class citizens, enabling them to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned as results. Key concepts include higher-order functions, immutability, and closures.

Higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce facilitate functional transformations on arrays, allowing for cleaner and more declarative code. Embracing immutability ensures that data remains consistent and predictable throughout the application's execution, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

Closures, another essential element, enable functions to maintain knowledge of the scope in which they were created, aiding in creating private variables and managing state.

Functional programming promotes code readability, predictability, and maintainability. It is particularly valuable when dealing with data processing, data transformations, and asynchronous operations in JavaScript. By adhering to functional programming principles, developers can write cleaner, more reliable code that is well-suited for modern web and application development.
